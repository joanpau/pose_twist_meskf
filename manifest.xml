     Extended Kalman filter to estimate robot pose and twist, using inertial and visual sensors.
     
     Actually it is an implementation of an error-state Kalman filter (ESKF),
     with multipiclative orientation error modelling.
     
     Imu's gyroscope and accelerometer readings are treated as control inputs.
     Visual pose estimates are treated as measurements.
     
     For portability the filter is implemented using the Bayesian Filter Library.
     The Eigen library is used for matrix computations.
